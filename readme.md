Creative Portion: For our creative portion, we did 3 things:
1) When and if a user is typing and is in the middle of sending text to a chat room, other users will be able to see that
the user is currently typing.
2) Ownership of a room can be transferred to another user.
3) When certain select strings are typed into the chat box, they are automatically converted into other strings. For example, if ‘god’
was typed, the chat system would replace it with "harambe".
