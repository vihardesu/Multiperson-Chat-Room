Creative Portion: For our creative portion, we did 3 things:
1) When and if a user is typing and is in the middle of sending text to a chat room, other users (in the same room) will be able to see that the user is currently typing. Added slight delay so that it isn't instantaneous.
2) Ownership of a room can be transferred to another user for functions such as kicking and baanning
3) When certain select strings are typed into the chat box, they are automatically converted into other strings. For example, if ‘god’ was typed, the chat system would replace it with "harambe". Words don't have to be standalone, works at any point in the code
